# RPMixedRealityCapture

Unofficial mixed reality capture software for Quest 2 without greenscreen, with support for usb webcams and android phones.  
Still a prototype, not yet usable (hopefully an alpha version soon).  
Based on [libQuestMR](https://github.com/RandomPrototypes/libQuestMR) for communication with the Quest and
[RPCameraInterface](https://github.com/RandomPrototypes/RPCameraInterface) for multi-platform camera interface.
