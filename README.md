# RPMixedRealityCapture

Unofficial mixed reality capture software for Quest 2 without greenscreen, with support for usb webcams and android phones (soon).  
Still a prototype, already usable but still need to finish the interface and do more testing.  
Based on [libQuestMR](https://github.com/RandomPrototypes/libQuestMR) for communication with the Quest and
[RPCameraInterface](https://github.com/RandomPrototypes/RPCameraInterface) for multi-platform camera interface (use the dev branch to compile with current version).
